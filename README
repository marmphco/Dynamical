Visualizing Dynamical Systems
Matthew Jee

Platform:
    The primary application requires Mac OS X. It has been tested
    on OS X 10.9.2. The dynamical systems and rendering libraries
    should compile on any Unix-based OS that supports OpenGL (with
    a few minor source changes).

Build Requirements:
    Building requires that Xcode and the Command Line Developer tools
    be installed. Just installing gcc or clang alone isn't be enough,
    the Makefile requires that xcodebuild be present.

Building and Running:
    To build, simply run `make` in the root project directory. This
    will build both the libraries and the main application. The
    application bundle, Dynamical.app, will be copied to the root
    of the project directory. If that doesn't occur, it can be
    found in OSX/build/Release/.

    If the the project does not build, a pre-compiled binary is
    already present in the root directory in archived form as
    Dynamical.tar.gz.

Files and Stuff:
    
    dynamical/
        Contains the source for the dynamical systems library

    renderer/
        Contains the source for the rendering engine

    OSX/
        Contains the source for the GUI application

    shaders/
        Contains the GLSL shader source

    report/
        Contains the writeup (writeup.pdf) and the online report

    screenshots/
        Contains screenshots and a video of the application

    examples/
        Contains some example Javascript files that can be opened
        with Dynamical.app
